<p>From my perspective, one of the most effective SEO techniques is a descriptive page title. A title tag, often known as a <title> tag, 
  is an HTML element that gives search engines and web browsers a title for the web page. In this way, title tags significantly affect the 
  webpage’s exposure, especially as it is considered as an unpaid visibility way to grab user’s attention and encourage users to click through to your website.
  Furthermore, page titles specify how a browser should display the page title in tabs. When visitors have several tabs open, this navigates them to the appropriate website. 
  To maximize its efficiency, a page title should be unique and include the major and target keywords related to the page's content. It is also highly recommended that the 
  length of a page title ranges from 50 to 60 characters to ensure visibility in search engine results without getting truncated.
